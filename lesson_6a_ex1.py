For this set of practice exercises, we will walk you
through the creation of a Tile class suitable for use
in your week five mini-project, Memory. This class will
model the logical behavior of cards/tiles used in Memory.
Our goal in walking through this design will be to
understand the syntactic structure of a Python class
in detail as well as the logic that goes into designing
a useful class. In Week 6b, we will use this Tile class
to re-implement Memory in an object-oriented style.
If, at some point, you feel confused, you may also want
to watch this video on the Basics of OOP by Julie.
Many students in previous sessions found it to be helpful.

To begin, your first task is to define a Tile class
using two lines of Python. For now, the body of this
class should just be a single pass statement to keep
Python from throwing an error. As usual in Python,
the body of the class definition should be indented.
