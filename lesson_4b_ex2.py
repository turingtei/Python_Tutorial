'''Complete the program template below so that each press of
the up arrow increases the radius of the white ball centered
in the middle of the canvas by a small fixed amount and each
press of the down arrow key decreases the radius of the ball
by the same amount. Your added code should be placed in the
keydown handler. (Note that draw_circle will throw an error if
the radius of the circle is decreased to zero or less.)'''
